# Diabetes Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing diabetes-related data to understand the relationship between two measurements. A linear regression model is used to predict one measurement based on the other.

## Data
The dataset contains the following columns:
- Date
- Time
- Measurement1
- Measurement2

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: The data is loaded and appropriate column headers are assigned.
2. **Model Training**: A linear regression model is trained using Measurement1 as the feature and Measurement2 as the target variable.
3. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess its performance.
4. **Visualization**: A regression plot is created to visualize the relationship between the measurements.

## Results
- The Mean Squared Error of the model is 4209.41, indicating the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
- The regression plot demonstrates the fit of the model, showing how well Measurement1 predicts Measurement2.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the potential of using linear regression in understanding diabetes-related measurements and their interdependencies.
